        <p style="border: 2px solid peru;">Hello there! I am Ian Miguel De Guzman Lancian. I was born on May 31, 2002 in Davao City, Philippines.
         My mother is Deanna De Guzman and my father is Rogelio Lancian. 
         I have 4 siblings, Dean Roger Lancian, my brother, Vanessa Lancian and Maria Luisa Lancian, my sisters.
         But sadly, both my sister, Maria Luisa and my father passed away in 2012. I was 10 years old at that time. 
         If I were to describe myself, I am happy person and a fun person. I grew up really a big fan of sports, especially basketball. 
         I was influenced by my relatives because they are also a fan of basketball. 
         My hobbies are playing sports and a little bit of cooking. It is important that we need to have time for ourselves. 
         Whenever I have a free time, I use that time to take a rest, watching movies, chat with friends, 
         do something that needs to be done inside the house just like arranging things, cleaning and exercise. 
         I am trying to keep myself to be active. But before doing all of this, 
         I need to make sure that there are no pending tasks to do.
